# Microsoft Office Automation VBA    
> 🚧 Under Construction  
>  This repo is under construction - Last Update: June 22, 2025.  
> Some features are not 100% done - Come back July 20, 2025, for all macros showcase.

💼 A professional collection of tools demonstrating automation capabilities across Microsoft Office applications using both **VBA** and **Python**. This repo also includes examples of advanced **Excel formulas** to showcase data manipulation skills without macros.  

This project demonstrates:  
- Legacy system integration via **VBA**  
- Modern scripting with **Python**  
- Strong understanding of **Excel functions and reporting**  
- Transition from UI-driven automation to backend scripting
